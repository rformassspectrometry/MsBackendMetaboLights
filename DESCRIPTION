Description: MetaboLights is one of the main public repositories for storage
             of metabolomics experiments, which includes analysis results as
	     well as raw data. The MsBackendMetaboLights package provides
	     functionality to retrieve and represent mass spectrometry (MS)
	     data from MetaboLights. Data files are downloaded and cached
	     locally avoiding repetitive downloads. MS data from metabolomics
	     experiments can thus be directly and seamlessly integrated into
	     R-based analysis workflows with the Spectra and
	     MsBackendMetaboLights package.
